# About
This is a project I made for CMPS 183 (Web Applications). I wanted to solve a problem I was having while streaming music with my friends. We had similar playlists but wanted to have the option to shuffle songs around the playlist in real time. Most streaming platforms offer collaberative/group playlists but I wanted to make something that allows voting in order to make streaming sessions more group oriented.

# Usage
To start, find or make a playlist on YouTube. It can contain any videos you want, not just music. After you have a playlist, click "Host" on the front page. Here you can enter a username and passphrase. Remember the passphrase you use because this is what your guests will use to access the stream. For the playlist url, paste the link to your playlist.

Then, your guests can click on "Guest" on the front page and enter the stream passphrase. Now they can listen, view, and vote in your streaming session!
